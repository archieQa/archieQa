# Hi there, I'm Luars Qamo (archieQa) ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ’¼ About Me
Hi, I have a deep desire to make and develop new ideas into actual code. I love solving problems, even though I suck at mathematics. I try my best to create innovative solutions. I am experienced in web application development and native development, so Iâ€™m a REAL full-stack engineer :)

During my time in Germany, I dove deep into web creationâ€”so deep that I decided, together with my bro CetiJunior, to open a web solutions company named CA - Web Solutions. We developed small, free projects for local businesses, making their online presence a reality.

A little after that, I wasnâ€™t impressed by front-end development anymore, so I decided to understand how to write backend logic for more complex systems. Since I had experience with JavaScript, I picked up Node.js, which was one of my best decisions because I fell in love with programming even more.

Now, with the abilities of LLMs (Large Language Models), I can write code even faster and could probably develop a full-fledged social network within a week. However, this makes coding a bit less fun for me.

Now, Iâ€™m on a path to finding out even more stuff, making myself an even more unbelievable asset to anyone in the tech industry.

I like to follow the entrepreneurial route, but to reach that point, I have to be an absolute asset first.

Thereâ€™s something about low-level coding that gets me going, and I want to figure out how to solve a big world problem with it.

Iâ€™ll keep this "About Me" updated always for self-documentation.

Thank you for reading! <3
