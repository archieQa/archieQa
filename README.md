### 💼 About Me

I’m obsessed with turning wild ideas into working code. Love solving real problems and hacking together creative fixes (math hates me, but I manage 😅).
True full-stack dev — web apps, native, you name it.

Back in Germany, I started CA - Web Solutions. We built free sites for local businesses and got them online properly.
Front-end got boring quick, so I dove into backend with Node.js. Best decision ever — made me fall even harder for coding.

Now LLMs let me ship crazy fast (could probably spin up a full social network in a week), but honestly… it kinda steals some of the magic.
Still grinding, learning deeper stuff, chasing low-level wizardry so I can eventually tackle a massive real-world problem.
Entrepreneurial vibes strong, but first I wanna become the kind of dev no team would ever let go.
Will keep tweaking this as I level up. 

Thanks for stopping by!
