# Hi there, I'm Luars Qamo (archieQa) 👋

### 💼 About Me
Hi there! I’m a former computer science student from Germany, now starting a new chapter in Malta. After completing two semesters in Applied Computer Science at Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg, I’ve relocated to Malta and am excited about pursuing my studies in computer science this fall, either at MCAST or the University of Malta.

During my time in Germany, I dived deep into programming, with my GitHub showcasing projects in JavaScript (frontend and backend). I love exploring new technologies and picking up fresh programming skills, and I’m eager to keep expanding my knowledge here in Malta.

- **Python**: Versatile scripting and automation projects.
- **JavaScript**: Full-stack development using the latest frameworks.
- **Java & Go**: Backend development and system-level programming.
- **C++**: Experimentation with low-level programming concepts.

While I may not be proficient in all these languages yet, I am dedicated to honing my skills daily and expanding my expertise.

### 🚀 What I Do
I actively leverage the latest **AI technologies** to enhance my learning process and to build innovative projects. I stay up-to-date with industry trends to ensure my work incorporates the best practices and cutting-edge solutions.

### 🔍 My Focus
- Developing full-stack applications with an emphasis on **scalability** and **security**.
- Exploring backend architectures using **Node.js**, **Go**, and other modern technologies.
- Experimenting with AI and automation to create intelligent, efficient systems.

### 🎯 On a Mission
I am committed to continuous improvement and growth as a developer. My goal is to become proficient across various programming languages and paradigms, adapting and applying my knowledge to real-world problems.
